# E-Commerce-ORM

A back end database was created to store information in different tables. Joins were used so that the data from different tables could communicate with each other. RESTful api routes are used so that a user can GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE data from any of the tables.The final product is a fully functioning E-commerce database that incorporates  multiple tables of data.
